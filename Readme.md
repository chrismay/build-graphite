Config to build .deb packages for the Graphite graphing library
(http://graphite.wikidot.com/faq).

Requires Virtualbox and Vagrant. Only tested on a 32-bit Lucid base box;
may or may not work elsewhere.

The .deb packages don't currently contain any pre or post scripts; they
just install the files and (some of) the dependencies.
